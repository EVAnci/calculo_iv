\DeclareMathOperator*{\res}{\text{Res}}

\DeclareMathOperator{\Seno}{sen}

\renewcommand{\sin}{\Seno}

% As we can't redefine \sinh (like with \sin)
% we just create a new command (idk if it's the 
% best way of doing this, but it works)
\DeclareMathOperator{\senoh}{senh}
% This should be fixed. As newcommand \senoh is 
% just a text with senh() 

% Cardinal sin
\DeclareMathOperator{\sinc}{sinc}
